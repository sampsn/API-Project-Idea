# API-Project-Idea

This is a repo for a project idea that utilizes public apis.

This is just a write up of the idea and not the actual code.

My idea may not suffice but its the idea that I have. It is something that I
would build for myself because there are already other tools like this but I
don't like the other companies implimentations of this idea. My idea would be to
have a very simple front end and database for uploading short clips and photos.
Those short clips and photos will automatically get posted to the various social
media platforms that you choose and authenticate with your account.

The main purpose is two fold. Number one, so that those that don't like to use
or have social media, can still take advantage of the marketing potential of
social media, but don't have to have the app on their phones. Second, it is very
tedious to login in to tiktok, post a video, go to instagram, post the video, go
to youtube shorts, post the video, go to facebook, post the video. etc. etc.
This simple site would just automatically upload to all the sites at once.

I would like to also impliment a sort of hack to marketing on social media. Each
account on the site will have their various accounts and all their uploads. Two
buckets. Accounts and Media. You can add many tiktok accounts, many instagram
accounts, etc. So you could have your main tiktok, and 3 fake "fan pages" and
you can automate posting videos from the bucket of media that you upload to. The
automation could just take videos and post them to different accounts at
different times according to how you set it up.

This tool is something that I would like to build for myself and my uses, and if
I create it to be simple and easy to use as well as powerful and functional, I
would like to then undercut the competition with a small monthly fee for other
poeple to use it.
